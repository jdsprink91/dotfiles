# sprinkle-nvim
Neovim setup that works for sprinkles.

## Python setup

1. Insert some documentation about how to get a consistent python3 going. Gotta set up your own virtual env and point to it
2. `pylsp` is set up with mason. This means you should follow [their rules about how to setup pylsp plugins](https://github.com/williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim/blob/main/lua/mason-lspconfig/server_configurations/pylsp/README.md)
2a. The three plugins you'll need are `pyls-isort`, `python-lsp-black`, `pylsp-mypy`
